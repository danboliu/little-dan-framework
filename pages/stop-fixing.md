# 🌊 Case Study: The Day I Stopped Fixing—after toilet awakening

---

## 1. Background

For much of my life, I believed that when something is wrong, it must be fixed.

If someone hurts another, you correct them.  
If chaos happens, you bring order.  
That was how I thought love worked—  
protect what’s right, punish what’s wrong, and restore peace.

But this approach, though logical, never brought real peace.  
It only fueled endless battles, especially during family conflicts where emotions ran deep and love seemed absent.

## 2. The Crisis

One ordinary day while working in office, chaos struck again:  
My child was hurt at home—not just by a minor accident fell, but by the absence of care in that painful moment.  
Instead of comfort, she was met with tasks: cleaning, organizing, solving other problems.  
Instead of a hug, they saw backs turned away, busy with chores and logistics.

The child cried out, not from pain,  
but from a deeper loneliness:

> “Why doesn’t anyone care when I’m hurting?”

## 3. What Could Have Happened Before

If this had been before a recent awakening in my life,  
I would have reacted the same way I always did:
- Explode in anger.  
- Blame the person who failed to comfort the child.  
- Punish the wrong and try to restore order through conflict.

It would have looked like justice.  
But beneath the surface, it was another layer of pain.

The child, seeing adults fight because of them,  
would have felt trapped in guilt:

> “It’s my fault again. I shouldn’t have cried. I shouldn’t have asked for help.”

The house would have fallen into chaos even more.

## 4. What Actually Happened

But something had shifted.

In a quiet moment not long before this,  
I had finally seen through the lie I had lived by:  
**Punishing what’s wrong doesn’t heal what’s hurting.**

So this time, I didn’t explode.  
I didn’t try to fix the person who failed.  
I simply turned toward the one who was hurting.

And said, calmly, truthfully:

> “You are good.  
> What you needed was love, and you didn’t get it.  
> Not because you aren’t worthy, but because some people simply don’t know how to give it.  
> That’s not your fault.”

Then I promised something to her:

> “You don’t need to carry this family’s pain anymore.  I promise I’ll never escalate the tension when it’s on fire.
> You don’t have to be the adult who solves the mess.  
> I’ll carry it.  
> You can just be a child.”

And she cried on my shoulder,  
not because of weakness,  
but because for once, she didn’t have to be strong.

## 5. The Paradox of Non-Fixing

Here’s the strange part:

I didn’t fix the person who failed.  
I didn’t solve the problem.  
I didn’t restore order.

But somehow, the pain softened anyway.

If I had fought, it would have grown.  
Because anger can’t heal absence.  
And punishment can’t replace love.

But by not fixing, by simply being present,  
the emotional chaos loosened its grip.

## 6. Reflection

I used to think peace comes after fixing what’s wrong.  
Now I see—

**Peace comes when you stop needing the world to be fixed in order to love it.**

The mess is still there.  
But in the middle of the mess, there’s a quiet space  
where love lives, even when the world doesn’t cooperate.

## 7. Takeaway

| If I had fought the one who failed | The pain would have deepened. |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| By standing beside the one who hurt | The pain was finally shared, and softened. |

I don’t tell this story because I did something noble.  
I tell it because I spent most of my life believing the wrong story.

And the day I stopped fighting reality,  
peace quietly found its way back in.
