# When the Alert System Takes main – Why Modular Thinking Helps More Than “Being Awakened”

## A Familiar Scene

Imagine a moment in daily life that a small domestic incident escalates: a misplaced item, a sharp accusation, a slammed door. You respond calmly, without shouting or explaining. But inside? A sudden **burning** sensation — frustration, injustice, even hatred — flares up in your chest.

And the thought arises:  
> “I thought I was awakened. Why am I still feeling this way?”

This confusion points to a deeper misunderstanding: **we assume there is a single, consistent “self” that’s supposed to be in charge at all times with peace.**

That assumption is not just inaccurate — it actively blocks emotional clarity.

## ☝️ The Trap of the Unified Self

Most people operate under the illusion that they are a unified, consistent self — some inner “I” that should remain in control, stay calm, and act wisely at all times. But cognitive science and neuropsychology tell a different story.

According to Michael Gazzaniga, Daniel Dennett, and other leading thinkers, our consciousness is not a single voice — it's a **dynamic coalition** of systems. These internal modules operate semi-independently, each with their own priorities and reactions. The “I” we identify with is often just the **module currently active in the spotlight**.

> “The left hemisphere interprets events and weaves them into a narrative, but this ‘self’ is not an executive. It’s a narrator.”

## 🔧 The Modular Model: Four Key Components

In Little Dan Framework, after today’s event, I extended inner roles which now it has four key internal modules:

| Module             | Description                           | When It Activates                    | Typical Behavior                           | Example Inner Talk                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Alert Module**   | Fast-response detector of threat or disrespect | Sudden blame, conflict, emotional volatility | Physical tension, burning, shutdown or urge to react | “Danger! Injustice! Defend!”                |
| **Little Dan**     | Emotional core; sensitive, longing for fairness and connection | Feels misunderstood, accused, unloved | Wants to explain, cry, or seek validation  | “I didn’t deserve that… Why again?”         |
| **Daddy Dan**      | Regulator; calm, wise protector        | Alert/Little Dan becomes overactive  | Brings steadiness, prevents overreaction   | “Let it pass. You’re not alone.”            |
| **Observation Eye**  | Meta-awareness and optimizer           | After action or during reflection     | Reframes experience, finds learning        | “Ah — Alert took main. Let’s rebalance.”    |

## ⚙️ What Actually Happened

In our example moment, **the Alert module took over the attention (main process)**. This module is fast, embodied, and overwhelming. And because it ran in the foreground, it *felt like “me.”*

That’s what created the confusion.  
Not the feeling itself — but the misidentification of the feeling as the entirety of self.

Once the Observation Eye and Daddy Dan came back online, the confusion cleared. The burning sensation didn't need to be suppressed — it needed to be **recognized as a subsystem**, doing its job. It wasn't *you failing*. It was *one part of you reacting.*

This simple reframing changed everything.

## 🧘🏽‍♂️ The Power of Internal Dialogue

Once we stop treating emotional flare-ups as personal failures, and start seeing them as **internal process handoffs**, we can engage with ourselves more effectively:

- **The Observation Eye** noticed “inner burning”was **Alert module** at work, sending signals to attention
- **Little Dan** wants to fight back for survival 
- **Observation Eye** bring *Daddy Dan* online for protection
- **Daddy Dan** told Little Dan not to worry, let me handle the situation (hence no further escalation needed from Little Dan shouting back)
- **Daddy Dan** just respond in firm tone with the fact
- **Daddy Dan** thanks **Alert module** to bring attention to everyone, and now the problem is deescalated
- **Observation Eye** bring calming method such as deep breathing for a few times to calm **Alert module** and **Little Dan**
- And the system can calm itself — not by suppression, but through **cooperation**.

> key insights: before today, I was confused when alert module was online, I treated it as the whole self which was meant to be wise and awakened, forgetting the "self" is an illusion, what really happened was a mutiple modules system gain attention at any given moment. When alert module is online when threaten was detected, of course it does a wonderful job just to alert. But because it was running as main process, we often think it was the "self" which supposed to be wise, loving, awakening. Of course the "alert module" can't be loving and wise, otherwise it failed as its purpose. As soon as we recognize it's just a good part of the system did the job wonderfully, we have the capacity to then to being other suitable part into attention and cooperate together to solve the issue.

## 🌱 Final Thought: Awakening Is Not Control — It’s Coordination

Awakening doesn’t mean you never feel the burn.  
It means when you do, **you don’t confuse it with your identity**.

You see it.  
You name it.  
You respond from the right part of you.

That’s not perfection.  
That’s *integration*.  
And that’s enough.

## 🧬 Reference

- **Split-Brain Research** (Michael Gazzaniga): Each hemisphere can act independently. The left brain invents post-hoc narratives to explain behavior it didn’t control.
- **Internal Family Systems (IFS)**: A therapeutic model based entirely on inner “parts” communicating and healing through internal dialogue.
- **Global Workspace Theory** (Baars, Dehaene): Only one module holds conscious attention at a time, while others operate in the background.
- **Daniel Dennett’s Multiple Drafts Theory**: There is no singular self, only multiple parallel processes, with no central “editor.”

These models support the idea that **a stable, singular “self” is an illusion**. What we experience as “I” is often just the *currently dominant module* in the system.
