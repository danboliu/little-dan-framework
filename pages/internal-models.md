# Exploring the Nature of Mental Models and Truth

In our conversation, we began with the premise that all mental models we hold in our minds are inherently imperfect. As George Box famously said, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." This means that while our internal representations of reality aren't perfect reflections of the world, they can still guide us effectively.

We then explored how our brains can only access these internal models, not reality itself. Communication between individuals becomes a way for us to collaboratively refine and adjust these models, ideally bringing them closer to the ultimate truth. Through open, curious dialogue, we aim to bridge the gaps between our perspectives and inch closer to a shared understanding.

When it comes to religious ideas, we discussed the perspective of Jordan Peterson, who often highlights the usefulness of religious frameworks in providing structure and meaning, especially for individuals who feel lost. While these fixed ideas can indeed offer stability and guidance, they also risk creating a rigid societal structure that resists change. The inability to challenge or adapt these fixed ideas can become problematic as reality evolves, potentially hindering the development of more harmonious and adaptive systems.

This is where critical thinking and continuous questioning, as advocated by thinkers like Sam Harris or Alex O'Connor come into play. By encouraging us to build flexible, evolving models of the world, they promote a mindset that can adapt as our understanding grows, reducing the risks associated with clinging to fixed beliefs.

Ultimately, our goal is to use a scientific approach, grounded in curiosity and openness, to refine our internal models and guide them closer to fundamental truth, rather than clinging to fixed ideas.
