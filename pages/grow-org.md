# Growing An Organisation

## The Seed of Discontent: The Pain Point

Our conversation began with a fundamental truth: change, especially disruptive change, doesn't happen in a vacuum. It springs from a "pain point." This isn't just about inefficiency or a missed opportunity; it's a nagging, pervasive problem that saps energy, stifles creativity, and ultimately, threatens an organization's long-term viability. We implicitly acknowledged that for any significant transformation to take root, it must address a felt need, a source of friction that people are genuinely motivated to resolve. Without this initial discomfort, even the most brilliant ideas remain abstract.

## The Sweet Spot and the Paradox of Power

From this pain point, we sought the "sweet spot" – the ideal leverage point to introduce change. Initially, this might seem like a top-down mandate, but we quickly pivoted. The true sweet spot, we discovered, wasn't about imposing control, but about ceding it. This led us to the paradoxical idea that promoting decentralization and empowering individuals could, in fact, increase one's influence. The traditional corporate ladder, where power is accumulated and guarded, gives way to a new paradigm: where influence is earned through enablement. By spreading seeds of autonomy, we argued, one cultivates a more fertile ground for collective success, and the original "seed-sower" reaps the benefits of that multiplied effort.

## The Art of Cultivation: Spreading the Seeds of Trust

This isn't about rigid pre-planning. Instead, it's about a more organic approach: "spreading the seed and letting it grow naturally." The core tenet here is trust. Trust in individuals to act in alignment with a common goal, even without constant oversight. When individuals feel trusted, they become willing participants in the collective endeavor, giving their best to achieve shared objectives. The multiplier effect of this collective effort then organically brings success to the idea's promoter. This isn't about manipulation; it's about genuine empowerment.

## The Elephant in the Room: The Fear of Loss

But then we hit a crucial roadblock, a deeply ingrained human tendency: the fear of losing control, particularly prevalent among leaders in large organizations. This fear, we acknowledged, often manifests as a desire to maintain the status quo, to cling to accumulated assets and past successes. It's a natural human inclination to avoid "danger" or "negative stuff," and in the corporate world, this often translates to a profound aversion to risk and uncertainty. We even touched upon the Jungian concept of "shadows" indirectly influencing this subconscious drive within leaders.

## The Paradox of Resilience: Embracing "Death" for Life

Here, our conversation took a philosophical turn. We argued that "change or uncertainty is the drive to build a resilient organism." This challenges the conventional wisdom that stability equals strength. Instead, we proposed that a truly resilient organization is one that embraces constant failure, viewing each misstep not as a setback, but as a valuable learning opportunity. This continuous cycle of "failing forward" builds a robust foundation of knowledge and adaptability. The concept of "death as a teacher" emerged, suggesting that confronting potential failure head-on, rather than denying it, stimulates our best selves and fosters true growth.

The danger, we concluded, lies in the expectation of continuous positive outcomes, leading to a fear of loss that paralyses innovation. True strength comes from building a culture where all assets and previous successes are leveraged not to avoid failure, but to build a system that trusts in continuous learning from it.
The Culture of Courage: Beyond Ego
This led us to the idea of a "culture of courage." It's about being "brave and adventurous in any career field," with the organization providing a safe space to do so. This implies letting go of ego, both individually and collectively, to focus purely on problem-solving. It's a shift from a blame culture to a learning culture, where the focus is on the challenge, not the individual who might "fail."

## The Thought Experiment: Bravery vs. Balance

We then conducted a thought experiment: which group would be more likely to succeed – those who fully embrace failure and death, or those who seek a "balanced" approach, with a touch of cowardice? Our conclusion leaned heavily towards the former: in the long run, the group that learns from and embraces failure will be more innovative, adaptable, and ultimately, more resilient. Fear, we posited, limits potential.

## The Origins of Control and the Illusion of Stability

This brought us back to the question: why do fear-based cultures and control mechanisms even exist? We identified it as a manifestation of a "lack of trust and a desire for control at the top." This "dream created by the manager" – the illusion of total control – is ultimately fragile and unsustainable. In a dynamic world, micromanagement stifles creativity and leads to stagnation.

## The Blueprint for Health: Flat, Open, and Adaptive

The antidote, then, is clear: a "healthy debate, a flattened organization, a truly two-way communication, and the embrace of failure as a culture." It's about empowering individuals to try new things and not be afraid to fall.

## The Spectrum of Risk: Accommodating All Personalities

Crucially, we recognized that not everyone is naturally "brave." People have inherent preferences for risk-taking. A truly healthy organization, therefore, must accommodate both "brave" and "conservative" tendencies. This isn't about forcing bravery on everyone, but about acknowledging and respecting individual autonomy in personality. The key is to provide a "place for them to do the ways they're comfortable with," ensuring that neither mindset is unduly prioritized over the other. Both contribute unique value.

## Leadership's Crucible: Unanimity Through Shared Understanding

At the top leadership level, where strategic decisions are made, the challenge intensifies. How do a group of 10 executives with diverse risk preferences come to a unified decision? We moved beyond simple democracy to suggest a process focused on "searching for the ground truth" rather than simply conveying opinions. This means fostering trust among the leaders themselves, allowing for full expression of individual preferences, and engaging in a collaborative search for the optimal path. Even if complete consensus isn't reached, the deep understanding gained through such a process makes the final decision more robust and accepted.

## Funding the Adventure: Internal Crowdfunding and Beyond

Finally, we explored practical mechanisms to fund this brave new world. Beyond simply allocating a small portion of a budget for risky ventures, we discussed the intriguing concept of internal crowdfunding. Initially, we considered employees using their own money, a "mini-startup" model. But we quickly refined this, acknowledging the potential discomfort of employees using personal funds. The stronger, more empowering approach is for the company to direct dedicated funding towards these employee-driven "adventure projects." This removes the financial burden from the individual while still fostering a sense of ownership and the potential for significant rewards if successful. This approach, by its very nature, promotes autonomy and provides a tangible pathway for internal innovation.

## Conclusion

In essence, our conversation traced a journey from the problem of stagnation to the vision of a truly resilient, adaptive, and human-centric organization. It's a call to confront fear, embrace uncertainty, and trust in the collective potential of empowered individuals, all while building a robust system that learns and grows from every experience, whether a triumph or a stumble.
