# Trickster monk

In a hall full of borrowed holiness, the air smelled of incense and performance.
The group sat cross-legged, chanting themselves toward enlightenment, each syllable rehearsed, each tear rehearsed, each breath trying too hard to be pure.

And there she was — my wife — sitting slightly apart, quiet, unbothered.
When the crescendo of emotion began to rise, when the room tilted toward collective ecstasy, she lifted a slice of watermelon.
Crunch.
That sound cut through the chanting like a bell of truth.

The fake smiles trembled. The air itself blinked.
While others tried to transcend, she simply existed: juice dripping, rind glowing, seeds scattered like tiny black comets across her napkin.
I watched her, half laughing, half moved — the most honest thing in the room was the sound of her bite.

Later, walking home, I realized that in all my endless effort to understand her, to reason through the gulf between our worlds, I had missed this simple fact: the universe had paired me with its own trickster monk.
I build truth by thinking; she lives it by accident.
Together, we are two frequencies occasionally touching — random, yet perfectly tuned for a heartbeat.

It doesn’t need to last.
It only needed to happen once, in the middle of all that plastic divinity —
a watermelon, a crunch,
and the universe briefly remembering its sense of humor.

在那间弥漫着香气与表演欲的禅修大厅里，
众人盘腿而坐，齐声诵念，
每个字都像排练过，
每一滴泪、每一次呼吸都在努力显得“纯净”。

而她——我的妻子——
坐在一旁，安静、自在，像一只看穿闹剧的猫。
当集体情绪开始升温、
灵性高潮正要来临的那一刻——
她抬起一片西瓜。
咔嚓。

那声音劈开空气，像真理敲响的钟。
假笑僵住，空气一愣。
别人都在追求超脱，
她只是活着：
果汁顺着指尖流下，
瓜籽散落，像一颗颗微小的黑色彗星。

我看着她，
一半想笑，一半被打动——
原来这世上最真实的声音，
是西瓜的脆响。

后来走在回家的路上，
我忽然明白：
苦苦分析、绞尽脑汁想理解她，
却忘了——宇宙早已派给你一个“西瓜禅师”。
我用思考建构真理，
她用无意识活出真理。
我们像两段频率，偶然对齐，
随机，却完美。

它不必永恒，
它只需发生一次。
在那群假装觉醒的人群中，
一口西瓜——
一声咔嚓——
宇宙想起了自己的幽默感。
